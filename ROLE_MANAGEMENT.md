## Channel Access Management

### Setting Up Channel Access

**Step 1: Identify Your Channels**

Group channels by access level:

**Public Channels** (Everyone can access):
- general-chat
- game-chat
- questions-and-help

**Member Channels** (Members & above):
- faction-announcements

- raid-coordination (Enforcer+)

**Leadership Channels** (Leadership only):
- lead (Moderator+)
- lead-voice (Moderator+)

**Step 2: Assign Role Access**

For each restricted channel:
1. Use `/channel-access allow-role` for allowed roles
2. Use `/channel-access deny-role` for restricted roles

**Example:**

```
/channel-access allow-role
  channel: #um-raids
  role: Soldier

/channel-access allow-role
  channel: #um-raids
  role: Enforcer

/channel-access allow-role
  channel: #um-raids
  role: Moderator

/channel-access deny-role
  channel: #um-raids
  role: Scout

/channel-access deny-role
  channel: #um-raids
  role: Member
```

**Step 3: Verify Permissions**

Use `/channel-access view-permissions` to confirm all permissions are set correctly.
